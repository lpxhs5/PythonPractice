# How to interact with databases. We need to use SQL statements. SQL is another programming language.

import sqlite3 # import sqlite3 library.
conn = sqlite3.connect("computer_cards.db") # connect to the database file using .connect method.

result = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM computer") # get data from the database using .execute method and an SQL statement.
# * means all feilds - select all feilds from the 'computer' table.
# this returns a 'cursor'. A cursor is how you access the data returned from your SQL statement, but the data needs to be fetched before you can use it.

# to fetch the data using this cursor:
computers = result.fetchall()

# The computers variable is actually a list of lists. Each row is returned as a list of fields.

# iterate over every list in the list of lists. Print each list, one by one.
for computer in computers:
    print(computer)
    
# to get an individual value, use an index:
for computer in computers:
    name = computer[0]   # fetches first element in each computer list only. Does this for each list because it's a loop.
    print(name)
    
    
conn.close() # need to close the connection to the database at the end.
