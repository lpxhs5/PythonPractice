# Reading/writing to CSV files using the python csv library.

import csv # imports csv library.
with open('foods.csv') as csvfile: # opens csv file as csvfile
    favourites = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',') # reads file using csv.reader() method and stores the data in favourites.
    for row in favourites: # iterating over each row in favourites.
        print(row) 
    
name = "Isabelle"
food = "Cherries"
with open('foods.csv', mode='a') as csvfile: # open in append mode
    favourites = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',') # uses csv.writer() method to prepare the file to be written to and sets delimiter to comma (separates each data element).
    #  This configuration is saved into a variable called favourites. 
    favourites.writerow([name,food]) # writes a new row with a list containing the contents of the name and food variables.
    

# You could also use standard file handling methods to read/write to csv files
# But using the csv library is better
# eg you can use csv.reader() to read in any data not in ' ' as a float type using the
# quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC argument:

#import csv
#with open('numbers.csv', newline= '') as csvfile:
#    favourites = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
#    print(type(favourites))
#    for row in favourites:
#        print(type(row[0]), type(row[1]))
