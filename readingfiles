f = open("food.txt","r")

# read contents of file into a variable called data, then print it.
# data = f.read()
# print(data)

# can also be done with a for loop:
for line in f:
    print(line)

f.close()

# can also use:
# with open("test.txt") as f:
#    data = f.read()
#    print(data)
# The with statement is a python thing that makes things easier, 
# it closes files automatically and can manage errors (incorrect file names). .
