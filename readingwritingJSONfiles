# This script says you how to use json files. Json files can store different data types
# and offer more flexibility than csv files. 
# json files are similar to python dictionaries in that they use a key-value structure.

# We are going to store some data in the json format.

import json # import json library
data = {
"Name": "Neil Armstrong", # a string
"Age": 82, # an integer
"Hobbies": ["Aircraft design", "Fishing", "Astronaut"] # a list of strings
}

with open("neil.json", "w") as f: # use open method to create a new json file.
    json.dump(data, f) # use dump method to write the dictionary to the new file.
    

# to import the json data back into the program:
with open("neil.json", "r") as f:
    data2 = json.load(f) # use the .load method and store as data2
    print(data2) # data2 is a dictionary, same as data.
    
# It's also possible to extract json files from the internet using the requests library.
# This library can also be used to send data files over the internet.
import requests
r = requests.get("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY") # data retrieved from internet and stored in object r.
NASA = r.json() # Data in r is parsed from JSON data into a Python dictionary using r.json().
print(NASA)
